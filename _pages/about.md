I'm a Member of Technical Staff at xAI. I was previously at the University of Pennsylvania studying CS and Finance under the [M&T Program](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/). I live in SF but call Delaware home. I'm a 2022 [Atlas Fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/).

##### Decision Theory \ Deep Learning \ Philosophy \ Violinist \ US-China

#### About Me
When I was young I did a ton of competition math, or rather my parents forced me to. But in high school I couldn't stop writing. Chinese consumer markets, Parfit's theory of personal identity, you name it. I'm obsessed with decision theory and philosophy.

At some point I discover computer programming. In 10th grade, I deliver my first full-stack gig for my local Chinese community school. Fast forward a couple years, and I'm at UPenn studying business and computer science. I spend most of my time in college building ML projects and doing dumb stuff like prediction market arbitrage. In my third semester, xAI offers me a job where I can work on chatbots and search. Of course I take it and move to SF.

I continue to think about decision making; I want to solve intelligence. Unlike Google, I don't want simply organize the world's information; I want to digest it and throw up beautiful insights. Deep learning seems like a good approach. I've picked up new interests, including defense policy and AAPI advocacy. One day, I want to lead in government and touch the lives of millions.

#### Some things I've done:
- Led RAG development at [pre.dev](https://pre.dev/)
- Worked on credit modeling at [Reprise Financial](https://www.reprisefinancial.com/)
- Managed growth and was a founding team member at [2.5 Intelligence](https://2.5.dev/)

At Penn I organized [Safe AI @ Penn](https://pennai.notion.site/SafeAI-Penn-Labs-a4f262c3061b46d2975667c97b964ad3).
