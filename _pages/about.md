I'm an engineer who wants to solve intelligence. My foremost interests are in <b>AI safety</b>, <b>graph learning</b>, and <b>human behavior</b>.

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying CS and Finance under the [M&T Program](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/). I'm a [2022 Atlas Fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/) and a [2024 xAI hackathon winner](https://x.com/Diego__Pasini/status/1845998296990654582).

I previously led all RAG development at [pre.dev](https://pre.dev/) and worked on credit modeling at [Reprise Financial](https://www.reprisefinancial.com/). Before that, I managed growth and was a founding team member at [2.5 Intelligence](https://2.5.dev/).

At Penn I organize [Safe AI @ Penn](https://pennai.notion.site/SafeAI-Penn-Labs-a4f262c3061b46d2975667c97b964ad3). I do contract data science work with [Wharton Analytics Fellows](https://ai-analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/for-students/wharton-analytics-fellows/), and I do research alongside [Machine Learning Research @ Penn](https://mlrpenn.vercel.app/).
