- Part of my research with Prof. Raghuram Iyengar at UPenn involves expanding the retrieval capabilities of knowledge graphs through integration with LLMs.
- Improved query answering robustness through autoprompted query generation and Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
- Engineered vector database and graph embeddings to increase retrieval speed and output relevance.
- To the right is a visualization of hundreds of nodes and edges in a Neo4j graph database, all related to the query "History of France".
